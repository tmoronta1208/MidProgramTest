# MidProgramTest

How many of the steps you were able to complete by the end of the exam?
  I was able to partially complete the first and second parts of the exam and was barely able to start the third part. 
  
Which parts/concepts you found easy to implement, or felt you understood how to implement well.
  The parts that were easy to implement were the basics - creating of new activities and fragments and starting new intents. 

Which parts/concepts you found hard to implement, or felt you did not completely understand how to implement well
  I struggled with a large portion of the material - Implementing recycler views with fragmants as well as Async tasks. I had a hard time getting 
  all of the pieces together and wasn't able to have a product that functioned.
